# socket-io-room-authorization

This project demonstrates the authorization in socket rooms. I've done it locally just to clear the concept otherwise can be build with cache etc.

Description: The first user creates the room with a password and if other user wants to join the same room, then user has to provide a password.

I've built this project to test and answer the question asked on stackoverflow.
